This is a plugin for Qmmp (1.2.0 or greater) which supports AdLib file
formats using AdPlug (http://adplug.github.io/).

The following packages are required, including development headers,
which some vendors split into separate packages:

• qmmp
• adplug
• qt5

To build, run Qt5's qmake (often installed as qmake-qt5) and then build
with make:

$ qmake-qt5
$ make

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Qmmp's input plugin directory.  To install
to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/staging
